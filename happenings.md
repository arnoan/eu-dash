#### Euregio Data Science Meetup
The Euregio Data Science Meetup is a monthly gathering for Data Enthusiasts of all backgrounds to learn, support and get to know each other in a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The focus is on building connections, helping each other out and learning by doing. You can sign up and find more information about our upcoming meetups [here](https://www.meetup.com/euregio-data-science-meetup/).

#### SCRUM Club Maastricht
The purpose of the SCRUM club is to explore and learn about software/tools for scientific computing and research. A good example of such a tool is R, a free and open-source software environment for statistical computing and graphics. A lot of time is therefore devoted to teaching/learning about R, especially at the beginning. Later on, other topics will be covered and discussed. All club members are invited to suggest topics of interest. You can find the SCRUM Club [here](https://wviechtb.github.io/scrum-club/).

#### IDS Workshop Series
The goal of the Institute of Data Science Workshop Series is to enhance the capability of the Data Science community through a set of recurring, low-barrier, hands-on seminars. The target audience are students and researchers, and also staff members and practicing professionals who wish to get exposure and deepen their knowledge and skills in Data Science. Participants should be familiar with basic programming and execution at the command-line. More information will be made available soon.

#### IDS Research in Progress and Journal Club Series
The IDS Research in Progress and Journal Club Series serves as a forum to learn about, discuss and critique high impact publications from all facets of Data Science. We welcome and encourage anyone to use our club as a platform to learn about exciting new developments and how techniques in this field can help you make sense of the data you care about. [Here](http://www.signupgenius.com/go/5080f4aaaad2da7f85-idsresearchinpro) you can find more information.

#### Social Coding Maastricht
A group of students, professionals and tech enthusiasts who combine expertise and know-how from various fields, share knowledge, explore, learn and build. Curious? Intrigued? Interested? Our doors are always open. [Here](https://www.meetup.com/if-coding-Maastricht/) you can find the meetup community.

#### BISS Lunch Lecture Series
